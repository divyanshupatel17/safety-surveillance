## SURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING SYSTEMS

A centralized solution designed to **identify, classify, and report workplace safety violations** using video surveillance data. The system continuously analyzes surveillance feeds to ensure compliance with predefined safety standards. The key violation categories monitored by the system are as follows:

1. **PPE Compliance**
   Ensures that all personnel are wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), such as helmets, gloves, goggles, and safety shoes, in accordance with task-specific safety requirements.

2. **Work at Height Safety**
   Monitors activities performed at elevated locations to ensure the use of certified fall protection systems, secure ladders or scaffolding, and adherence to permit-to-work procedures.

3. **Hot Work and Welding Safety**
   Detects unsafe hot work practices by verifying the presence of valid work permits, fire watch personnel, proper shielding, and the use of flame-resistant PPE during welding or cutting operations.

4. **Machine Safety**
   Ensures that machinery is operated safely by monitoring the presence of machine guards, adherence to lockout/tagout procedures, and compliance with regular equipment inspection protocols.

5. **Pedestrian Safety**
   Identifies unsafe pedestrian behavior by enforcing designated walkways, detecting unauthorized entry into restricted zones, and monitoring proximity to moving machinery or vehicles.

6. **Vehicle and Material Handling Safety**
   Monitors the safe operation of vehicles and material handling equipment by ensuring trained operators, adherence to speed limits, proper load securing, and the use of spotters in congested work areas.

7. **Housekeeping and Site Cleanliness**
   Evaluates workplace housekeeping standards by detecting obstructions, unmanaged waste, and cluttered work areas that may lead to slips, trips, or falls.

8. **Fire and Emergency Safety**
   Detects fire-related hazards and emergency preparedness issues by monitoring fire and smoke incidents, ensuring the availability of fire extinguishers, verifying clear evacuation routes, and confirming the display of emergency contact information.

9. **Access Control and Restricted Area Monitoring**
   Controls entry into high-risk or restricted zones by monitoring unauthorized access, verifying identification where applicable, and ensuring only authorized personnel are present.

10. **Behavioural Safety**
    Promotes a proactive safety culture by identifying unsafe behaviors, tracking repeated violations, and supporting training, observation, and positive reinforcement to encourage compliance.
